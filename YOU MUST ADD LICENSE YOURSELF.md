MIT license includes the name of the copyright holder, this is why I am not including a license in this repo.

On GitHub click `Add File` -> `Create New File`. Type `LICENSE` for the file name and a `Chose license template` button will appear, click this and select `Apache 2.0` -> `Review and submit`. Name this new file `LICENSE-APACHE` so we can add multiple and commit. Now do the same but for the `MIT` license.

Of course you do not have to use `Apache 2.0` and `MIT`, you may use whatever license you please, these two are just to most common for the Rust ecosystem.
